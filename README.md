# [Automated-Yoga-Pose-Estimation](https://github.com/Sanskarsghyar/Automated-Yoga-Pose-Estimation)

Undergraduation project | Supervisor: Dr. Tushar Sandhan

Develop an AI-based program for the estimation and identification of yoga poses, which can be used as a self-guidance practice framework for individuals to practice yoga postures without getting help from anyone else

- Extracted the 33 important keypoints as feature vectors from the individualâ€™s skeleton using Mediapipe
- Enhanced features by incorporating 8 essential joint angles and normalized keypoints w.r.t. pose center
- Trained KNN and ANN model, and achieved an accuracy of 99% for training and 96% for testing dataset
